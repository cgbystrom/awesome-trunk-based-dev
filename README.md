# Awesome trunk based development [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of everything related to trunk based development.


## What is trunk based development?

A short summary taken from [trunkbaseddevelopment.com](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) describes it as this:

> A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques, avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.

For a more in-depth introduction to the idea, I highly recommend the linked site above by [Paul Hammant](https://paulhammant.com/).

Since I've been maintaining a list of sites, videos and blog posts on trunk based development, I figured it could be of more use if I made it public instead. It's simply a collection of links on this topic :smile: If you'd like to contribute, do send a pull request!

Pull requests are more than welcome. The common theme above are challenges that arise when scaling the number of developers while keeping a central infrastructure (be it VCS, build systems, CI servers and so on).
